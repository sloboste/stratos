This document contains the comments that I have about the API given in 
"flash.h", "spi.h", and "swipe.h".


flash.h:
	I think that the flash memory should be responsible for managing keys to
stored data rather than the programmer. What I mean by this is that the
programmer should not select what index at which to store the data; the flash 
memory should select a key for the data return it to the programmer. Following
is what I think the flash_store function prototype should look like:
/* Public: Store a buffer into fash memory.
 *
 * The flash memory is organized into key:value pairs. You can store and
 * retreive a buffer of infinite length from any given index.
 * 
 * buffer - The data to store in flash.
 * length - The length of the buffer.
 * 
 * Returns the index of the data in flash if the data was written successfully
 * to flash.
 * Returns -1 if the index or buffer was invalid.
 */
int flash_store(uint8_t buffer[], size_t length);

Also, having the ablility to store a buffer of inifinte length requires the
programmer to keep track of how large each stored buffer is so he can then 
allocate an appropriately sized buffer for retrieval of the data. The programmer
should not have to do this. One solution to this problem is to have the flash 
memory keep track of how large each buffer is and make that size availble
through a function with the following prototype:
/* Public: Check how big the buffer stored at this index is
 * 
 * index - The index of the data in flash
 *
 * Returns the size of the buffer stored in flash at this index
 */
 unsigned int flash_size_at(int index);
 
A second solution would be to limit the size of the buffer that can be stored
so that the programmer passes in a buffer of a fixed size each time
flash_retrieve is called.


spi.h:
	The API is limited because it only allows for one slave on the SPI bus. The
spi_read and spi_write functions do not include the slave_select signal which
is normally used when there are multiple slaves. While this is not a problem
for the single-client coding challenge, it would be a problem if future
versions of this system were to require additional slaves.


swipe.h:
	I'm not entirely sure if this would be a good idea or not, but **assuming
that the cards we are dealing with follow the ISO/IEC 7813 standard for
finiancial transaction cards**, I think it would be more intuitive to pass in a
struct to the swipe_enable function rather than a buffer containing the stripe
data. The struct would look something like this:
	struct StripeData {
		track1_t t1;
		track2_t t2;
		track3_t t3;
	};
Of course, the types track1_t, track2_t, and track3_t would have to be defined
based on the number of bits required for each track. Also, the swipe_enable
function would have to convert the StripeData struct into the format necessary
to write it to the stripe. What I'm trying to say is that it probably would be
helpful to know what the magnetic stripe data looks like and store it
accordingly to make using the stripe data in the program easier in case more
functionality needs to be added to the host processor's program.  
	I referred to the following documents for information on magnetic stripe
cards and the ISO/IEC 7813 standard:
